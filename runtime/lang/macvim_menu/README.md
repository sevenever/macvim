This folder contains MacVim-specific menu translations. While Vim already has menu translations, MacVim has some unique menu items and some Vim menu items are renamed to fit Apple's HIG better. As such, they need to be translated as well. Note that not 100% of the menu items in all locales are all translated right now, but the majority of them should be covered.

Each locale has up to two translation files that will be sourced into the main menu translation file for that locale:

* <locale>.apple.vim: This contains official Apple translations for common menu items such as "New Window" and "Font". They were auto-generated by using a script (`src/MacVim/scripts/extract-specific-localised-strings.swift`) to extracts official translations from Apple Developer's glossaries (https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=glossaries).
* <locale>.custom.vim: This contains custom translations that don't have easy official translations to look up and have to be manually translated.
